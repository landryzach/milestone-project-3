This is supposed to be a used car marketplace. The goal is to have a home page with sign-in or register options and a marketplace page that shows all cars that have been listed with an option to add a new listing or edit a current listing. I still have a long way to go, and I am all over the place. I am stuck on the authentication, so I have no migrations and seeder info yet. I am going to continue working on this, but I understand this needs to be graded so I'll take whatever the project deserves as is. If there is anything you see that can/will help me to complete this, please let me know.
