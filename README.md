This is supposed to be a used car marketplace. The goal is to have a home page with sign-in or register options, and there will also be a marketplace page that shows all cars that have been listed with an option to add a new listing or edit a current listing. I still have a long way to go, and I am all over the place. I am still working on the authentication, so I have no migration and seeder info yet. I am going to continue working on this, but I understand this needs to be graded so I'll take whatever the project deserves as is.
