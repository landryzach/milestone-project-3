This is supposed to be a used car marketplace. The goal is to have a home page with sign-in or register options, and there will also be a marketplace page that shows all cars that have been listed with an option to add a new listing or edit a current listing. I still have a long way to go, and I am all over the place. I am going to continue working on this, but I understand this needs to be graded. Regardless of what the grade is, I'd appreciate your feedback to improve/fix what I've done.
